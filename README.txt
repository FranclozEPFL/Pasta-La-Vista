## Preview tips
1. The index.html file can be opened directly in local browser. This method is recommended for local preview.
2. If you would like to deploy the html to a remote server, please follow these steps: copy all the files that under this directory to the server > delete index.html > rename remote.html to index.html > visit with the remote address.
3. If you need further assistance, please shoot us an email at support@jongde.com.


## Moving Forward 
From this point onwards, our main focus is to:
1. Show the mock application to several users to locate the major flaws in the design to polish the UI further.
2. Figure out how the map design should work to provide easy and intuitive work for users.
